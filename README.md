Hello !

This a Type Script + Node Js from a quick start .

There is three scripts here

npm run build - npx tsc ---- compiles from src/*ts to dist/*js

npm run start - node dist/index.js runs compiled js from dist folder

npm run dev - nodemon src/index.ts watches changes from index.ts

Just a quick start for you project !
